          Charles Michael "Chuck" Palahniuk (born February 21, 1962) is an
          American novelist who describes his work as transgressional fiction.
          He has published 19 novels, three nonfiction books, two graphic
          novels, and two adult coloring books, as well as several short
          stories. His first published novel was Fight Club, which was adapted
          into a film of the same title.

      <h2>Early Career</h2>
      <p>
        He wrote for the local newspaper for a short while but then began
        working for Freightliner Trucks as a diesel mechanic, continuing until
        his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote manuals on
        fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job to which he did not
        return until after he became a successful novelist. Palahniuk quit his
        job as a journalist in 1988. He performed volunteer work for a homeless
        shelter and volunteered at a hospice.
      </p>

      <h2>Fight Club</h2>
      <p>
        After his first novel, Invisible Monsters, was rejected, Palahniuk began
        work on his first published novel, Fight Club. Initially a short story,
        it was expanded into a full novel and published in 1996. The novel
        received positive reviews and some awards, although it had a short shelf
        life until the film adaptation revived its popularity.
